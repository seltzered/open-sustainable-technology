Can these success stories inspire us in our most vital challenges today? Deep Dive into Open and Sustainable Technology \u00b6 In our search for open and sustainable technology, we have come across a number of very ambitious and high-quality projects. Unfortunately, there was no sign of activity in most of them. Many of these projects are open source but hard to find. As there is no project index in this area so far, it is not easy for developers worldwide to find these \"gems\" and to build upon the work already done. This results in time loss and inhibits innovation. Focussing on active projects helps us to ensure active communication and knowledge transfer. Many domains already show the emergence of strong communities. Based on our research, we were able to identify a general trend towards open and sustainable technologies. In the last two years, in particular, a large number of astonishing projects have been developed. In particular, the photovoltaic and wind turbine sector shows a large number of professional projects. It was very impressive to see a 15-MW offshore wind turbine, which was developed in cooperation between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Technical University of Denmark. Almost all technical documentation has been provided under the MIT Open Source License [3] . This standard will allow companies and research institutions to further develop and use this technology without major intellectual property barriers. Many tools around the development are also available under an open license. On the basis of these technologies, it is possible to secure a large part of the energy supply for entire coastal regions. Although this is a historic step, the 62 stars on GitHub indicate how little attention is still paid to this field. A CAD model of the nacelle layout of the 15-MW direct-drive wind turbine. Hidden Gems \u00b6 In the field of energy system modeling and climate research, we found some larger communities and projects which have evolved over a long period of time. Many high-quality data sets can be found in this area. Unfortunately, even after intensive research, some areas are still very thinly covered. These include the areas of energy storage, carbon capture, bioenergy, recycling, and waste. Especially in the area of waste classification by artificial intelligence, we expected a lot of software and datasets. The sad truth is that there are hundreds of large open source projects to classify and track people, but only a handful for classification and segmentation of waste within an image. Even the largest project in this field, called TACO, seems to be unable to get the attention it deserves and has no sponsors today [4] . In general, the impression is that most projects are developed further by public institutions, research institutes, and private individuals. Large companies can only be found in a few places. The global impact of companies investing in open sustainable projects is much larger when enabling others to do the same. Segmantation and classification of litter with TACO A Direct Comparison \u00b6 Since protontypes also maintains an awesome list in the field of robotics, we are able to make a direct comparison between the two fields. The number of active and high-quality projects maintained by a worldwide community is significantly larger in robotics [5] . Many projects build upon each other and simplify research and development. If we had the same level of activity and contribution within the field of sustainable technologies, we would be very confident that climate change and the loss of natural resources can still be averted. Through our organization protontypes we will accelerate the trend towards open and sustainable technology. The list of awesome sustainable technologies is the first central piece of the puzzle that was missing. In this way, we hope to increase the transfer of knowledge in this area and help others identify areas not covered by open toolkits and data sets. Especially in the field of software development, this will enable people around the world to tackle one of the most central problems of our time from the comfort of their own homes. The strength of open development methods is already clearly visible in many high-tech areas.

The reasons for this are manifold and can be supported by social and technological arguments. Applications range from open hardware such as wind turbines and PVs to open data and software packages that are publicly available for modification and redistribution. Using open source technologies is critical to deliver cross-system sustainability goals as they offer: Trust . Open practices ensure transparency and trust in the deployment of various technologies and keep governments and other actors accountable to their climate pledges . Localisation and customisation . Open, sustainable innovations allow for customisation of individual and cultural needs throughout the product development process. Climate Justice . Open access to knowledge, data and technologies can help reduce the power imbalance . When we centre climate action around those who bear the burden of environmental injustice, we can discover new empowering uses for open technology. Resource efficiency . Multiple actors are investing in data products, algorithms, and software, leading to duplication, incoherent outcomes, and inefficient use of resources. Open source means each problem only has to be solved once. Collaboration . To address complex challenges related to climate change, cross-functional collaboration between different sectors is necessary. The complexity of planetary sustainability cannot be met by solutions based on a single discipline, state, or enterprise. The health and vibrancy of open sustainable technologies \u00b6 Developing and maintaining open-source software relies on an integration of the technical (e.g. how open-source code is engineered and maintained); the social (e.g. the communities around particular open source projects and their values); and the organisational (e.g. formal open source institutions and cross-cutting regulations, financing, and governance). While we see a broader trend toward open source technology projects, there is no evidence on which projects can be considered critical digital infrastructure for climate change mitigation and where significant funding and resourcing gaps exist. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic study of these intricacies and dynamics of the open source landscape with a focus on sustainability applications. After a year of intensive mapping of the open source software landscape for climate action on OpenSustain.tech , we will analyse the health and vibrancy of this emerging ecosystem . The selection of projects was based on simple rules from the Contribution Guide . We want to discover: areas where this digital infrastructure is mature; where tools or processes exist that funders should support instead of forging a new path; new possibilities to connect various projects; and general concerns and hurdles that have limited the development of best practice. We expect that triangulating these dynamics would shed light on important economic and governance issues that lead us towards a more diverse and well-funded ecosystem for critical digital infrastructure for planetary sustainability . Our approach \u00b6 We have collected, crowdsourced and curated ~1000 actively developed open source projects. Using this database as a starting point and the GitHub API we will analyse the interrelations & dependencies between key projects as well as the number of contributors, project growth, and key topics and organisations among other metrics. This analysis will highlight thematic gaps and provide a better understanding of the criticality of specific projects. We are using a variety of the CHAOSS Metrics to measure the state of a project. We acknowledge that solely using Github for our quantitative analysis is a limitation of our approach and plan to add more platforms soon. In addition, beginning in January 2022, we will conduct a series of interviews with project developers and contributors to learn about their challenges, incentives, and needs; the financial viability of these projects; and the barriers that have hampered the development of best practice and more equitable developer communities. Finally, beginning in spring 2022, we plan to strengthen the interconnectivity of different developer and user groups through a series of community workshops . Preliminary findings \u00b6 In our preliminary analysis we discovered that many projects exist in the solar and wind turbine sectors, as well as data-rich domains like energy system modelling and climate science. Unfortunately, other areas, such as energy storage, emissions monitoring, and sustainable financing, are still underserved or underdeveloped. If we use the number of stars as a measure of popularity, we quickly notice that even the most successful projects in the field are very unpopular compared to other areas such as open source robotics . Our research also revealed that many of these initiatives are still hard to find and difficult for programmers and scientists to build upon.

Given the complexity of the changes required, a global and open collaboration is essential. Here are 4 reasons why a transition towards sustainability should follow open practices. Transparency and Trust \u00b6 A sustainable economy requires a common understanding of how our actions affect the environment. It is the question about which practices and technologies are sustainable in the long term. In practice, many options show a high degree of complexity and it is not always certain whether a solution will be economically, environmentally or socially sustainable. Can recycling of solar cells been done in an economical way? Could carbon capture and storage be an economically and environmentally viable option? Is the land used to produce biofuel crops competing with the production of food? Open practices can be crucial to ensure transparency and trust in finding answers. Open datasets, models and access can create a global discussion without running the risk of being covertly influenced by individual interests. This approach has already created a global scientific consensus of the human impact on climate change with results that can be reproduced by everyone. Another challenge is to reach a shared understanding of what steps are needed to address this issue. Tools such as open life cycle assessments play a central role in measuring the environmental footprint of products and services. With the help of public data and open models, it creates transparent metrics to evaluate their sustainability. This practice provides widespread trust, encouraging sustainable behaviors among consumers and businesses. Knowledge Evolution and Adaptation \u00b6 Open Data and models are not the only fields building transparency and trust. Opening knowledge and technology will make our economy more sustainable. The tools we use nowadays to design new technology are the result of centuries worth of collaboration. They emerged in the form of mathematics, algorithms, and programming languages. Today, 70% of the world's codebase is open source and software development has become one of the most innovative industries. The results are revolutionary and cutting-edge developments in robotics, artificial intelligence or blockchain, just to name a few. With the advancements made in global communication, we can apply the creative methods behind software development to more traditional fields. With knowledge available to everybody, people will be able to maintain and adjust technology by themselves. For example, open agriculture can be used and adapted by farmers to improve their crops' sustainability. Practices like these enable faster global transition that meets local conditions and cultural needs. Collaborative Innovation \u00b6 In his 2003 book \u201cOpen Innovation\u201d , Chesbrough first coined the term open innovation as a novel innovation strategy. Initially, it meant a straightforward contradiction of the traditional and secretive R&D mindset towards corporate innovation. However, the trend for openness and collaboration between and within companies has rapidly expanded. Over time, it has become an active innovation-seeking path for the whole ecosystem that further pushes the technological development and knowledge boundaries. Most importantly, this collaborative approach is crucial when considering the ever-increasing product complexity. An aspect that makes it difficult for even the largest companies to carry out the whole development process in-house. In particular, mobility solutions, food and changes in our housing characteristics require the personal and cultural needs to be included in the design process from the beginning. Otherwise, we run the risk of developing sustainable solutions without taking people's lifestyles into account. Two evident benefits of adopting an open innovation strategy are the setting up a common language between the contributors and standardization of ways to collaborate. This, in turn, translates into substantial competitive advantages from the commercial perspective: better adaptation for new business opportunities, increased flexibility in the developed solutions, as well as a faster and cheaper route to launch a product into the market. Most importantly, by integrating users into the design processes, the idea of partnership towards a larger and shared goal also brings new ways of doing business. Open Business Models \u00b6 Free and open practices emerged with the idea of empowering freedom for all users. Also, the advantages of cooperative software development for common standards and a higher code quality became obvious. What seems unimaginable to many is the development of a profitable company based on free and open practices. Nonetheless, over the last decade, companies have shown with great success how sustainable and open business models can look like. Open Core, as one of the most prominent open business models, combines the practices of adaptation, transparency and collaborative innovation. A new billion-dollar business methodology has emerged and provides the basic infrastructure for our digital world. What initially seemed possible only for software development is now being transferred to new areas as can be seen in the development of semiconductors with the rise of the RISC-V initiative. Hundreds of organization are working together to create an open ecosystem to ensure free and open design of computing architectures and processors in the future. The same mindset can be applied to other sustainable technologies that define our lives. The advantages of applying an open practices to the development of sustainable technologies are cleared up. The baseline for this development has already been set by many projects and is now visible through the projects listed at OpenSustain.tech . It is now up to us whether or not we are able to apply the practices that have brought us the greatest innovation to the problems that challenge us the most.","title":"Open Principles for a Sustainable Technology Transition"},{"location":"blog/open_principles_for_a_sustainable_technology_transition/#open-principles-for-a-sustainable-technology-transition","text":"Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 Alejandro Aristi \u00b7 Tjark D\u00f6ring \u00b7 January 29, 2021 A transformation towards a sustainability-driven economy will challenge all of the upcoming generations.

This, in turn, translates into substantial competitive advantages from the commercial perspective: better adaptation for new business opportunities, increased flexibility in the developed solutions, as well as a faster and cheaper route to launch a product into the market. Most importantly, by integrating users into the design processes, the idea of partnership towards a larger and shared goal also brings new ways of doing business.","title":"Collaborative Innovation"},{"location":"blog/open_principles_for_a_sustainable_technology_transition/#open-business-models","text":"Free and open practices emerged with the idea of empowering freedom for all users. Also, the advantages of cooperative software development for common standards and a higher code quality became obvious. What seems unimaginable to many is the development of a profitable company based on free and open practices. Nonetheless, over the last decade, companies have shown with great success how sustainable and open business models can look like. Open Core, as one of the most prominent open business models, combines the practices of adaptation, transparency and collaborative innovation. A new billion-dollar business methodology has emerged and provides the basic infrastructure for our digital world. What initially seemed possible only for software development is now being transferred to new areas as can be seen in the development of semiconductors with the rise of the RISC-V initiative. Hundreds of organization are working together to create an open ecosystem to ensure free and open design of computing architectures and processors in the future. The same mindset can be applied to other sustainable technologies that define our lives. The advantages of applying an open practices to the development of sustainable technologies are cleared up. The baseline for this development has already been set by many projects and is now visible through the projects listed at OpenSustain.tech . It is now up to us whether or not we are able to apply the practices that have brought us the greatest innovation to the problems that challenge us the most.","title":"Open Business Models"},{"location":"blog/openness_as_a_key_indicator_for_sustainable_investment/","text":"Openness as a key indicator for Sustainable Investment \u00b6 Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 January 29, 2021 An open-source strategy for measuring sustainable investments can fundamentally impact the transition to a carbon-neutral and green economy. Measuring corporate sustainability based on quantitative physical values combined with Open Science practices has the potential to avoid greenwashing as the biggest threat to economical transformation. In the coming decade, the world will face profound changes in order to establish ecological norms and rules for our economy. The financial industry will be at the center of this transition, determining which companies and technologies are granted the resources they need to spearhead this evolution. In recent years there has been a systematic shift toward evaluating companies not just on monetary but also on ethical and environmental criteria. Non-financial factors known as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) are frequently used to evaluate companies. Today about 40% of total assets worldwide under management are sustainable investments rated by ESG scores [1] . The high demand for such financial products is driving massive growth, with a predicted market share of over 95% by 2030 [2] . Figure 1 clearly shows the massive growth in this sector: Figure 1: Global AUM invested in ESG mandates (in USD tn) Despite this promising development, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide are still accelerating [3] . Humanity stand to lose climate stability and biodiversity, and thus our livelihoods, before the end of this century. Why is the trend toward sustainable investment not reflected to the same extent in physically measurable environmental variables? The following figure clearly shows how little CO\u2082 emissions are influenced by the trend towards sustainable investment. Figure 2: Annual CO\u2082 emissions They are not measured on the impact they deliver \u00b6 People in the financial industry are becoming increasingly aware of this inconsistent development. Today's ESG ratings are questioned by insiders from numerous institutions. Kenneth P. Pucker sums up the problem in his blog post \"The Trillion-Dollar Fantasy\" in a single sentence [4] : \"They are not measured on the impact they deliver\". Deutsche Bank's former ESG officer, Desiree Fixler, publicly expressed her concerns regarding the legitimacy of the company's claims on the percentage of assets under management that merit an \"ESG\" or green label. [5] . Tariq Fancy former Chief Investment Officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock argues his essay \"The Secret Diary of a Sustainable Investor\" [6] : We need political leaders who are competent, evidence-based, and sufficiently non-partisan to focus primarily on how we can fix the rules of the game. Given the sheer volume of sustainable investments, it should come as no surprise that businesses around the world are trying to represent their existing business models as green and sustainable in terms of ESG ratings. Without a positive evaluation, these companies will probably lose a large part of their future investment. As a result, considerable greenwashing has increased in recent years. [7] . ESG is used to measure the quality of green marketing campaigns \u00b6 Thus one of the critical pieces for the green transition is establishing the appropriate methodology and standards to accurately evaluate the impact of companies on the environment and society. When examining ESG scoring in its current form, it becomes clear that robust scientific approaches do not inform these \"measurements\". Instead, companies produce ESG reports using a range of questionnaires that vary significantly by industry. ESG rating agencies process these reports using a mix of manual and automated methods. For example, natural language processing algorithms, a subset of artificial intelligence, are used to process public media and sustainability reports to assess how \"green\" a company is behaving [8] [9] . ESG experts worldwide advocate for the standardisation of ESG reports and hope for guidance at European Union. [10] . However, since this is an empirical topic, one should rather look in the direction of science. Since the current methods of ESG ratings are also known to companies, they are trying to \"represent\" their own company, technology and business models as ecologically as possible to the outside world under all circumstances with the help of massiv green marketing. If you take a closer look at the algorithms and methods, you will see that ESG is used to determine the quality and quantity of green marketing campaigns. The following figure shows how such an assessment is created today using data-driven approaches. [11] Figure 3: A Data-driven Approach to Environmental, Social and Governance Independent scientific analyses and peer reviews of their own reports are the exception here. Each company designs its ESG reports at its own discretion. Also reports from the media are in the rarest cases purely objective nature and it is therefore very questionable to include them. Political and corporate influence on the public media can not be denied in many countries. Reproducible knowledge creation \u00b6 Science has faced similar challenges in the past as it does today with respect to ESG. The complexity of scientific experiments has led to the so-called replication crisis [12] . New tools such as neutral networks and other very complex processing chains of data made scientific results very difficult for other scientists to replicate. The published papers were not sufficient to inform outsiders about the underlying data, instruments, methods, and steps. In many respects, this development is analogous to the reports on the impact of companies on their environment. In the field of climate science, but also in many other scientific fields, there has therefore been a fast transformation in recent years. The triumph of Open Science, Open Access, Open Data and Open Source can no longer be denied [13] . Satellite data, climate models, software tools and the associated programming languages are now open and freely available. Instead of arguing about the results of non-transparent studies, it is now possible to discuss scientific details of how the results were obtained. However, as long as this is done according to open principles, discussions remain scientific, objective, and evidence-based. Thus, even the last doubts about the existence of climate change could be dispelled. Today there are no studies based on open principles, which are able to disprove the existence of climate change. Open Science and scientific discourse create reproducible knowledge. Open science communities like Pangeo represent prime examples of this field and show how Earth Science has been transformed by Open Source and Open Science. Emerging patforms like Papers with Code or Journal of Open Source Software created a new mindset on how knowledge can be published and reviewed in public. Within the energy modeling community, a key backbone of the energy transition, there is a strong trend toward open knowledge modeling. Whether and to what extent our energy supply can be covered by purely renewable energies can therefore be discussed transparently, in detail and scientifically by scientific communities such as openmod in order to find a common consensus. Figure 4: Open Data and Open Source creating a transparent energy system modeling The trend to openness in general is also strongly visible in digital industries creating a new mindset on how to do business. Emerging Business Concept like \"Open Core\" have led to IPO of $11 Billion just by a single company called Gitlab in 2021 [14] . Commercial Open Source Software Companies and Open Source in general is changing the way how data is processed and how we make decision based on the results [15] . 85% of software products today stands on the shoulders of the Open Source movement [16] . Precision and automation are not always valued \u00b6 Unfortunately, this mindset is only found in very limited use within ESG and sustainable investment. This becomes clear when looking at the active Open Source projects in this domain. Based on OpenSustain.tech , there are only 10 active Open Source projects in the area of sustainable investment. Even the strong project like SBTi Temperature Alignment tool , OS-Climate or r2dii.analysis are very small compared to other Open Source projects. As part of OS Climate, a number of companies including Amazon, Red Hat, Airbus, Goldmann Sachs, and Microsoft have joined together within the Linux Foundation to develop an open framework for climate related investments. However, if you take a look at the repositories behind, you will quickly realize that the project is still far from a practical application even after 2 years. Although Open Source is known to provide solid and global standardization for the processing of data, there is only one attempt to standardize the ESG scoring method itself. Cary Krosinsky and the team of Real Impact Tracker released their methodology on GitHub with a blog post giving more background information [17] [18] . Nicolaas Koster, Matthias Memminger and Stefan Woerner published similar articles about the high potentical of an Open Source ESG framework and methodology [19] [20] . Despite all these initial thoughts and first good efforts, no professional Open Source rating ESG framework can be found today. ElectricityMap is one of the very few commercial Open Source platforms with a community and a technical solution that is appropriate to solve problems related to business impact on climate change. But even CEO Olivier Corradi admits that automation and precision are less in demand than one might think when it comes to corporate carbon footprints [21] . Figure 5: Nicolaas Koster illustrates how ESG is suffering from a lack of transparency Source Openness as a key indicator for sustainability \u00b6 Nevertheless, the problems within sustainable investment clearly show that transparent and repeatable ESG scoring results are in demand. A company that makes it possible to disclose its own sustainability on the basis of \"Open Science\" has an unbeatable unique selling point in the battle for green investments. In the rating of companies, \"openness\" has the potential to become a criterion in itself making clear to what extent data and models behind the ESG reports of a company are disclosed. This allows the uncertainties and associated error bars to be calculated over sustainability statements. It enables the development of an independent scientific community concerned with corporate sustainability. Openness about one's own sustainability would demonstrate the will to transform even those companies that have not yet made much progress in this area. Unfortunately, recent developments have shown that decisions about the sustainability of industrial sectors and technolgy are not subject to transparent scientific evaluation. Decisions in this area are strongly influenced by intrasparent political decision-making processes [23] . A study based on Open Science principles would provide a transparent and objective answer to the question of whether gas power plants or nuclear power have a positive impact on the environment. It would also allow to talk about risks and potentials if these technologies are used worldwide in a larger scale. Conclusion \u00b6 The Open Source and Open Science movements have changed the way how to collaborate on digital product development and science today. Yet there is not a single company in the world that transparently discloses its impact on the environment through Open Science. Such a development, however, is the only way to verify the multitude of climate pledges made by companies. Many countries and civil organizations are already showing how such a development can look like. The question is how to incentivize companies to enable Open Science for their own environmental sustainability. One way would be to measure the openness of ESG reports and their underlying data and models.","title":"Openness as a key indicator for sustainable investment"},{"location":"blog/openness_as_a_key_indicator_for_sustainable_investment/#openness-as-a-key-indicator-for-sustainable-investment","text":"Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 January 29, 2021 An open-source strategy for measuring sustainable investments can fundamentally impact the transition to a carbon-neutral and green economy.
